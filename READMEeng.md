# *ilyOs*
## *Basic Information.*
IlyOs is an operating system created to seek the comfort of its users through recommendations that they themselves can make. The system is based on Windows 10, in a way that takes up less space and removing applications or derivatives that do not fit in it.
This operating system is focused on speed, since many things have been removed that will later be explained in the different sections.
Some things are very specific and depend on each person, so I have decided not to change them because they are based on each person independently.
This guide or this project is personal, it has not been supported by third parties, but it may receive donations as a method of gratitude, although **they are not necessary**.
- **I do not assume any responsibility** for what you are going to do with this operating system, if you or anyone else has broken your hardware, your peripherals or your Windows installation, no one will be responsible for it, only you.

## *Downloads:*
- There is no download link at the moment due to this being a beta, only a few testers will be able to use it. When the time is right, the link will be posted.
- Please do not download this OS from sources other than links posted by @IlyOs.
- If you have any kind of bug, [*contact us*](https://twitter.com/7ilyOs).

## *Unattended installation:*
The installation is completely unattended for the **Spanish** language, because the project is located in **Valencia**. If you want to change the language, you will have to do so after finishing the installation.

### **How ​​can I get IlyOs?**
You can install IlyOs from the links I will post periodically when I see fit to release the update. I will try to do it as soon as possible.
### **What does IlyOs remove?**
IlyOs relies on user feedback, but there are many unused or unnecessary options, which is why I have been removing them. Any application that has been disabled can be reinstalled, but it will be up to you to do so. The following things are removed:
- Everything related to Hyper-V.
- Internet Explorer.
- Windows Hello.
- Cortana.
- Eye control, calls, content delivery manager, and narrator.
- Xbox (**Everything related to it**).
- All default applications that come with installing Windows 10 except **Calculator**, **Groove Music**, and **Photos**.
- Remote Desktop in its entirety.
### **What's new in IlyOs?**
IlyOs' function is to remove all components that can slow down the computer and generally keep the operating system as clean as possible. This does not mean that you cannot install the applications you want once you install the system on your machine, it will be your responsibility.
### **How ​​much space do you need to install IlyOs?**
You need approximately 10GB, which means that it will take up 16GB less compared to the base Windows provided by Microsoft. This number is not exact, **it can vary** so it is recommended to have at least 25 / 30 GB of space so that IlyOs can navigate normally and quickly.
